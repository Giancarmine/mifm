# MIFM
The APK ditributed with Roidmi ( http://www.roidmi.com/ ) is sadly only in Chinese language.
For some people (including me) that might be a problem. But the device is purely awesome so I just translated it to English.

Not everything is translated yet but I'm working on it.
Also I encourage anyone to help me!
If you want to help just fork this project. Add your translation and do the pull request.

For latest releases just look here: https://github.com/kkszysiu/mifm/releases

# How to help us

We highly recommend to use https://www.transifex.com/mifm/mifm/ to make a new translations.
This repository is highly integrated with our Transifex, everytime someone change something, we will release new version.
(there's a script that if checking if there was any updates to the translations and if there are - updates the translations and build new version with new apks)

This is very handy and gives our developers/translators very nice UI. Even a non-programmer can help us making new translations and this is soo cool! :)

If you want to help us, just register on Transifex, join our project and start translating!

Quick Tip:
I highly recommend to change this option and set it to English. That way you will see English translation texts instead of Chinese!
