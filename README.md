# MIFM
The APK ditributed with Roidmi ( http://www.roidmi.com/ ) is sadly only in Chinese language.
For some people (including me) that might be a problem. But the device is purely awesome so I just translated it to English.

Not everything is translated yet but I'm working on it.
Also I encourage anyone to help me!
If you want to help just fork this project. Add your translation and do the pull request.

For latest releases just look here: https://github.com/kkszysiu/mifm/releases
